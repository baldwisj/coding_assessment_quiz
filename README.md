# coding_assessment_quiz

This is a coding assessment intrended to quiz students on their Javascript knowledge and compare their previous scores to improve.

## Description
This website was created with the knowlege of Javascript that I gained so far in this coding bootcamp. The largest factors of success through my own eyes is the proper implementation of DOV navigation and apendatures as well as proper use of local storage.

## Usage
This quiz was created to provide a multichoice evaluation of general JavaScript questions to prepare a student for future coding challenges and work. The score and initials opf the student will be stored and displayed in a highscores page.

## Conclusion
Durning my creation of this webpage I have learned and sharpened many of my coding skills. These skills include:

* Further understanding of JavaScript basics such as getElementByID, arrays, if-else, and for loops.

* I gained more thoughough understanding web API functionality including DOM structure and navigation, event listeners, and appending.

* I gained a better understanding of local storage and how it can be used to provide the user with previously used information.

* I created DOM elements through Javascript to animate my webpage.

* I acheived a better understanding of objects and dta attributes.
